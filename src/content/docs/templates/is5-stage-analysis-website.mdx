Below are raw and rendered mdx (markdownx) for a template IS5 strategy section on the website. You can view the raw code at the bottom if you collapse the Strategy Section or if you go to the Raw tab of the overview. The `import`s should only appear once in the file. In the event you are proposing a change to the website directly, you should format your strategy section as follows:



## Rendered
